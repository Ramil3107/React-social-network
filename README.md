#### This project is the final work step on the React: Way of the Samurai course, which includes 100 lessons. While taking this course, I learned React, Redux, Flux Architecture, etc. This project is not about design, it acts as a kind of playground in which Iâ€™ve implemented the material studied. The back-end is provided by the course author.
